# globals

> Global identifiers from different JavaScript environments

<<<<<<< HEAD
It's just a [JSON file](globals.json), so you can use it in any environment.

This package is used by ESLint 8 and earlier. For ESLint 9 and later, you should depend on this package directly in [your ESLint config](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/language-options#predefined-global-variables).

**This package [no longer accepts](https://github.com/sindresorhus/globals/issues/82) new environments. If you need it for ESLint, just [create a plugin](http://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/working-with-plugins#environments-in-plugins).**

## Install

```sh
npm install globals
```

## Usage

```js
<<<<<<< HEAD
import globals from 'globals';
=======
const globals = require('globals');
>>>>>>> packages

console.log(globals.browser);
/*
{
	addEventListener: false,
	applicationCache: false,
	ArrayBuffer: false,
	atob: false,
	â€¦
}
*/
```

Each global is given a value of `true` or `false`. A value of `true` indicates that the variable may be overwritten. A value of `false` indicates that the variable should be considered read-only. This information is used by static analysis tools to flag incorrect behavior. We assume all variables should be `false` unless we hear otherwise.

For Node.js this package provides two sets of globals:

- `globals.nodeBuiltin`: Globals available to all code running in Node.js.
<<<<<<< HEAD
	These will usually be available as properties on the `globalThis` object and include `process`, `Buffer`, but not CommonJS arguments like `require`.

	See: https://nodejs.org/api/globals.html
- `globals.node`: A combination of the globals from `nodeBuiltin` plus all CommonJS arguments ("CommonJS module scope").
	See: https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_the_module_scope

When analyzing code that is known to run outside of a CommonJS wrapper, for example, JavaScript modules, `nodeBuiltin` can find accidental CommonJS references.
